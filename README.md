1. Hello sir, You dont have to install any database to run this application as the database that i have used in this blogging app is H2. It comes out of the box with springboot application.
2. You can run this app the normal way by going to the src folder and running the main java file.
3. you can also use docker to run this application as i have dockerized this application.
4. Hoping, for a positive response from you.
5. Thank you very much for this oppurtunity.
